# Validation - Movie

We select 320 movies (from the movies with conflicts) from the raw database and crawl data facts about directors using the combination of movie name and release year for identification. We then manually check the facts about some uncertain movies. The `MID` is the id used in our code, while you can replace it with the combination of movie name and release year.
